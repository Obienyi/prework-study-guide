# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide webpage was created as a result of what we learned during the Prework. My desire for information regarding the creation and design of websites is my motivation for creating one. It solved the problem of not being able to build a website. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript that we have learned.
